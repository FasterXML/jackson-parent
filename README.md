# jackson-parent

This project is the ultimate parent pom for Jackson 2.x components: for most indirectly
via [jackson-base](../../jackson-bom).

It defines some defaults but much of this has been moved to above-mentioned `jackson-base`
(and `jackson-bom`) over 2.x release schedule; this project will not be used at all
with Jackson 3.x.
